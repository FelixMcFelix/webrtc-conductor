# WebRTC Conductor [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/FelixMcFelix/webrtc-resource-manager.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/FelixMcFelix/webrtc-resource-manager)
A lightweight module to allow for efficient and simple management, creation, reuse and destruction of WebRTC DataChannels.

Presently, the module is extremely unstable and is functional up to the point where I can use it with a small amount of difficulty in my project. Over time, I will fix and extend this module as needed.
